Hello. Welcome to my site. A so called 'Digital Garden' - which is a fantastic term. 

I am going to use this to post my notes and to cultivate my own garden of knowledge. 

I would note that this is not my main vault and instead is a curated one. I want there to be a level of quality in this and my main vault is full of random, arguably meaningless notes. To continue the 'garden' metaphor, it is an undeveloped plot of subpar land. I want this space to be prime real estate. Now there are certainly some 'brownfield' sites in my main vault which will be worthy of publishing. But this will come after some re-development. 

# Topic 
- If you are interested in creating your own digital garden then please check out: 
- Andy Mathcusek - this is a brilliant example of this concept in action. 
- For the mechanics of how to use Obsidian (a brilliant PKM application) as a base for your digital garden please check out [this](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden)
- This is a bit difficult to  set up but is worthwhile doing. It makes things easy to type and is just a great way to have your notes. 
- I am a big proponent of the concept that publishing is a way of enforcing accountability.
